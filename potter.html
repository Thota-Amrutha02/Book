        <h1>Harry Potter</h1>
        <p>by Arun Tiwari</p>
        <p class="text">The 3 Mistakes of my Life," by Chetan Bhagat, follows the interconnected lives of three young friends, Govind, Ishaan, and Omi, as they navigate the turbulent landscape of Ahmedabad in the early 2000s. Govind, with a penchant for business, dreams of success, while Ishaan, a talented cricketer, aims for the national team, and Omi, a loyal friend, grapples with his own limitations. Their aspirations and the challenges they face, including religious tensions, an earthquake, and personal mistakes, test their friendship and the very foundations of their dreams.
